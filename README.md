I've made a React three.js portfolioa few years ago, but it didn't fully fit my style. I've started working on a plain old html/css portfolio to put my projects, resume, contact info, etc.
with minimal js. One, because I like the simple and efficient look of "basic" web design, and also for google score and speed tests.
