                        <p> My name is Alex Wisco, and I am a software developer from Canada. I am currently working as a software/web developer
                            with a startup company <a href="https://www.biggabed.com/"> Biggabed </a>, GM of Recruitment for
                            <a href="https://www.topdrafthockey.com/"> Top Draft Hockey </a>, and freelance web developer.</p>

                        <p>
                            I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Amherst College. I played Varsity hockey and was named All-Conference Academic team all four years.
                            Before Amherst, I played two years for the Navan Grads in the CCHL in Ottawa, Ontario. I set the Grads franchise record for most career and single season shutouts (2018).

                        <p>
                            Although most of my background in programming and computer science is more academia-based, I've recently found myself learning and practicing front-end development 
                            more and more everyday. I started combining my knowledge of mathematical/computer science principles with my passion for front-end development and web design, which can be found
                            on my projects page. I hope to continue to hone my fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, while also growing as a front-end developer.

                       <p>
                           I have previously worked as a Robotics and Coding instructor at <a href="https://www.zebrarobotics.com/"> Zebra Robotics </a> in Toronto,
                           a Data Analyst for DataForce, and I have 10+ years experience as a hockey goaltending coach.
                           Outside of coding, my hobbies include finding new music, playing videogames, hiking/birdwatching, and working out.
